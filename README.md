Ideas for persistent. Investigations of working with Named Records.

## Introduction

Current `persistent` package is good but have some disadvantages:
* Code is generated by TH which reduce composability
* No decision for projections of `entity`
* No instruments for working with views/stored procedures/direct select
* Others?....

Here I want to try to check some ideas in this field.

The first one is storing data in some kind of Named Records using `Symbols` for type-level checking.
I was excited with using `Symbols` in [Servant](http://haskell-servant.github.io/) library. 
And I want to try something similar for Persistency.
Another source I saw is [Record](github.com/nikita-volkov/record) library.

## Named Records

I hoped to find decision with properties:
* O(log n) time to get field from record by name
* record construction independent from order of fields definitions
* no TH preferrable, some TH possible
* projections and joins are desirable

I tried to implement it using "very-well balanced tree" (I don't know the right name) on type level. 
This is a binary search (by name) tree with count of left items is the same or one more than on the right side (for each subtree).
The problem is construction. I realized it with [FunDeps](https://github.com/odr/pers/blob/master/src/NamedBTree.hs) and  with [TF](https://github.com/odr/pers/blob/master/src/NamedBTree2.hs). 

User should write 
```haskell
type Rec = () <+ "a":>Int <+ "b":>Char <+ "c":>String
rec = () <+ (V "c" :: "c":>String) <+ (V 1 :: "a":>Int) <+ (V 'b' :: "b":>Char)
```
or
```haskell
rec = () <+ (V "c" :: "c":>String) <+ (V 1 :: "a":>Int) <+ (V 'b' :: "b":>Char) :: Rec
```
and got 
```haskell
rec = (((),V 1,()),V'b',((),V "c")) :: (((),"a":>Int,()),"b":>Char,((),"c":>String,()) 
```
(Constructions like `(V 1 :: "a" :> Int)` rather ugly. Any ideas are welcomed... Perhaps some TH?)

But compile time for [user application](https://github.com/odr/pers/blob/master/app/Main.hs) is absolutely blocked this idea!

I tried also to make a type-level sorted list but it is also too complicated for ghc.
